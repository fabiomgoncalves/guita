= Blundle dependency =

The OSGi blundles which one wants to trace GUI code should have a dependency to:
{{{

}}}
This will cause the bundle to be instrumented, and it is the only thing that has to be included/excluded in the projects' source.


= Launch configuration =

The launch configuration should include the following bundles:
{{{
org.aspectj.runtime
org.aspectj.weaver
org.eclipse.equinox.weaving.aspectj
}}}
The last bundle should have {{{Auto-Start = true}}}.

Finally, the following VM argument should be included:
{{{
-Dosgi.framework.extensions=org.eclipse.equinox.weaving.hook
}}}
