**Goal**

This is a toolkit embracing mechanisms for performing interaction-driven code tracing, i.e. code exploration activities that use a program's GUI as the means to comunicate developer intent.

**How**

The toolkit instruments an existing application, so that one may click on a widget (using a specific keystroke) and obtain in the IDE (Eclipse) a trace of every line of code since the creation of the widget until the last method invoked on it.
